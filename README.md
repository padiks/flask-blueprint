## Set up enviroment & requirements

```
$ cd project_folder
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install --upgrade pip
(venv) $ pip install Flask
(venv) $ flask run
```

## 📁 **Project Structure**

```
project_folder/
|
+-- app.py                       # Main entry point (creates Flask app, registers blueprints, runs server)
|
+-- config.py                    # Global configuration (DEBUG, SECRET_KEY, database paths, etc.)
|
+-- core/                        # App-wide global infrastructure (app factory, error handling, extensions)
|   +-- __init__.py              # Marks core as a package
|   +-- app_factory.py           # Application factory (create_app) and blueprint registration
|   +-- extensions.py            # Optional: Initialize shared extensions (db, login manager, etc.)
|   +-- errors.py                # Global error handlers (404, 500)
|
+-- apps/                        # Modular isolated feature blueprints (home, addition)
|   |
|   +-- home/
|   |   +-- __init__.py          # Home blueprint definition
|   |   +-- routes.py            # Home routes (views)
|   |   +-- templates/home/
|   |       +-- view.html        # Home page template

|   +-- addition/
|   |   +-- __init__.py          # Addition blueprint definition
|   |   +-- routes.py            # Addition logic and routes
|   |   +-- templates/addition/
|   |       +-- view.html        # Addition page template
|   |
|   +-- <other-modules>/         # Future blueprints (subtraction, multiplication, etc.)
|
+-- templates/                   # Global/shared templates
|   +-- base.html                # Main layout (navbar) with dynamic {{ title }}
|   +-- 404.html                 # Global 404 error page
|
+-- static/                      # Static assets
    +-- css/
        +-- style.css            # Global styles

### 1️⃣ **Separation of concerns**

* `core/` → global infrastructure (app factory, error handling, extensions).
* `apps/<module>/` → isolated feature blueprints (`home`, `addition`).
* `templates/` → global layouts (`base.html`) with dynamic `{{ title }}` and error pages (`404.html`).
* `static/` → CSS, JS, images.

Everything has a **clear place** — no spaghetti code in `app.py`.

---

### 2️⃣ **Scalability**

* Adding a new module is **copy + rename + register**.
* Blueprints allow you to **group related routes and templates**.
* You can have dozens of features without cluttering the main app.

---

### 3️⃣ **Maintainability**

* Routes, templates, and logic are isolated — easier to debug.
* Global things (like error pages or extensions) are centralized in `core/`.
* Team collaboration becomes much simpler.

---

### 4️⃣ **Flexibility**

* You can easily add databases, login systems, or APIs via `core/extensions.py`.
* URL structure is clean and configurable via `url_prefix`.
* Templates and static files can be organized per module or globally.
* Dynamic page titles supported via `{{ title }}` in `base.html`.

---

### ✅ Summary

This is **exactly the approach used in professional Flask projects**:

* Minimal `app.py` as entry point
* Core infrastructure separated
* Modular blueprints for features
* Clean template and static structure
* Dynamic titles with `{{ title }}` in templates

This setup is **fully correct for web development** — small, clean, and scales nicely, which is the whole advantage of Flask over “everything in one file” frameworks.

The **10 steps we documented are purely about the programming logic** that makes your app modular and scalable:

1. **Config class** → centralizes settings.
2. **App factory** → creates the Flask app instance.
3. **Blueprint definitions** → separate modules (`home_bp`, `addition_bp`).
4. **Blueprint routes** → handle URL endpoints.
5. **Template rendering** → each blueprint has its own templates.
6. **Error handling** → global error registration.
7. **Application entry point** → runs the app.

Everything else (empty folders, base templates, CSS, JS) is optional or supportive—they can **download or create those themselves**. The focus of the 10 steps is **purely the programming logic** that makes the app modular, maintainable, and scalable.
